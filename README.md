1.	Create an algorithm to get a series of numbers and by pressing 0 calculate the average of those numbers, then print the maximum, the minimum and the average number.

variables 
number
otherNumbers
numberOfNumbers
minimumNumber
maximumNumber
averageNumber

initialize


process
check numbers 
if(number<otherNumbers)
print "number is maximumNumber"

if(number<otherNumbers)
print "number is minimumNumber"

add all numbers up and * numberOfNumbers
print "number is averageNumber"



2.	Create a flow chart that calculates the Pi based on the 10 first term of the following series 
     4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + 4/13-â€¦






3.	Create a simple VB, C or JavaScript program that calculates the factorial of a given number. 
var i = givenNumber;
var sum = 1;
while(i >0){
    sum *= i; 
    i -= 1;
}
console.log(sum);



4.	Create a flowchart for adding numbers from 1 to 1000 using Gauss method.
